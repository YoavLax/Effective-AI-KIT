# Icon Setup

## Required: Add Extension Icon

You need to add a `icon.png` file to this directory with the following specifications:

- **Size**: 128x128 pixels (PNG format)
- **Style**: GitHub Copilot themed icon
- **File name**: `icon.png`

### Options to get a GitHub Copilot icon:

1. **Create a custom icon** inspired by GitHub Copilot's branding (avoid trademark issues)
2. **Use GitHub Copilot's official logo** (if you have permission from GitHub)
3. **Design your own** that represents AI assistance and code development

### Design Tips:
- Use colors that match your gallery banner (#C80000 red with dark theme)
- Ensure it's recognizable at small sizes
- Keep it simple and professional
- Consider using AI/code-related imagery

Once you add the `icon.png` file here, it will be automatically referenced by your `package.json`.
